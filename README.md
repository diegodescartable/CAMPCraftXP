# Read Before Use

**1** - Set your game to 1280 x 720 Bordered Window mode (Your Fallout76prefs.ini should have the below lines)

		bFull Screen=0
		bBorderless=0
		iSize H=720
		iSize W=1280

**2** - To avoid material costs, you need Contractor Perk maxed (Level 18 minimum)

**3** - You need to create a blueprint with 1 foundation and all items on top of it. Two suggestions:

		A regular foundation with 49 rugs stacked
		A ramp foundation with 49 Wind Chimes on the side

Those two option will cost 0 mats as contractor perk will give you the same mat cost back. (you just need to have enough materials to craft 1 blueprint. The  49 amount its because 50 is the max amount of items you can put in the blueprint and you need room for the foundation. Other options with less items can work too, but the script will expect to scrap 50 items anyway.

4 - You must be in CAMP mode in the Blueprints tab and the preview must show your blueprint as placeable (green) and your aim should be somwhere on the foundation as this will be used to scrap the foundation and store all the items at once as soon as it placed (provided your mouse doesnt move, I will try to control for this in the future)

### Usage

**ALT + P**  -  Start the script

**ALT + Z** - Stop the script

**Tab**, **Z**, **C**, **E**, **Esc**, **Space** - Force abort script to avoid accidental scrapping since they are CAMP UI keys

Note: A log will be created in ths script's folder containing some information on execution and errors
